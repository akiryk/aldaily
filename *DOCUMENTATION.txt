Theme skeleton has been built based on themeshaper tutorial:
http://themeshaper.com/2009/06/22/wordpress-themes-templates-tutorial/#wrapper

Custom code for portfolio has been added to function.php:
Register custom post type
Register thumbnails
Register 'what we did'
Make custom meta boxes (Tutorial is here: http://www.ashbluewebdesign.com/2010/09/wordpress-portfolio-tutorial-custom-post-types/ )
Created a folder called "includes" and put 'metaboxes' scripts in it. Metaboxes gives a lot of control over content and appearance of meta boxes.

Registed a nav menu in functions.php so that I can take advantage of WP 3.0 appearance > menu options. See 
Make sure you go to Appearance > Menu and choose primary menu name from the Primary Menu name dropdown on left.

Created a home.php template and set it as the index page. See http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-basic-portfolio-wordpress-theme

Turned off links on currently selected page using Remove Link to Current Page plugin

Changed the "What We Did" widget in CMS to "Portfolio Tags" I'm not sure how to use these, but I think they can serve like tags but exclusively for portfolio items.
